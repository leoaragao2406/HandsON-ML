#Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow ‚Äî Study Repository
This repository contains my notes, code exercises, and projects based on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aur√©lien G√©ron. The book provides a practical, hands-on approach to learning machine learning and deep learning using Python's most popular frameworks.

What This Repo Covers:
Fundamentals of Machine Learning: Supervised/unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and more.

Practical Tools: Scikit-Learn for traditional ML, Keras and TensorFlow for deep learning.

End-to-End ML Projects: From data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and deployment.

Advanced Topics: CNNs, RNNs, NLP, GANs, and reinforcement learning (depending on the edition).

üõ†Ô∏è This repository is meant to document my learning progress and serve as a reference for others following along with the book.
